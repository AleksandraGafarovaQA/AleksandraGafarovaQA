# Hello, World!

## About me
My name is Aleksandra. Since the end of 2023 I have begun studying and practicing as a QA Engineer. As just a beginner with a strong passion for work, I'm happy to be envolved in such an interesting world, where I can successfully develop myself and grow professionally ensuring the high quality of software products and services. Since I do not have any commercial experience at the moment, here, in my portfolio, I would like to share my knowledge and practical skills which I have gained through QA course and self-study. My wish in the nearest future is to be someone who is making the difference in software testing.
